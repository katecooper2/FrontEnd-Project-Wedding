#Introduction

The project brief was to create a Spring back-end using CRUD functionality and integrate this with a front-end webpage using HTML and JavaScript.
Project Management: Clear documentation from a design phase, an expanded Jira board and code integrated into a Version Control System.
Databases: MySQL database and connected h2 databasewith full functionality.
Java and Spring Boot: Functional application created in OOP language.
Testing: 97% test coverage in src/test/java on back-end testing (MockMVC).
Front-End Development: Functioning front-end website with API integration.

#Planning

Using Jira Software I created a Scrum board  and created the user stories and epics. From the user stories I created child issues for the front and back end of my project to keep a record of what needed to be done and what had been completed. An example of this is shown:

#Databases

In this project I used two types of database, a local H2 database which was used for testing the back-end and a MySQL database.

#Testing

Here are the JUnit tests in the back-end Spring application.
To make sure that the program was working, I used MockMVC integration tests to create a mocked Controller class. It performed mock HTTP requests and let me test the outcomes of each HTTP endpoint.

#Front-end

The front-end webpage consits of HTML files, CSS syling, and JavaScript files. The webpage allows users to create a guest, select whether they belong in the Bride or Groom's party, delete and guest and view all of the guests in their list.
